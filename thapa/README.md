# **Coda Waves**

When an earthquake or underground explosion occurs in the earth, seismic waves are propagated away from the source. After P waves, S waves and various surface waves are gone, the area around the seismic source is still vibrating. The amplitude of vibration is uniform in space, except for the local site effect, which tends to amplify the motion at soft soil sites as compared to hard rock sites. This residual vibration is called seismic coda wave, and decays very slowly with time. The rate of decay is the same independent of the locations of seismic source and recording station, as long as they are located in a given region.

If you shoot a gun in a room, the sound energy remains for a long time due to incoherent multiple reflections. This residual sound has a very stable, robust nature similar to seismic coda waves, independent of theÂ·locations where you shoot the gun or where you record the sound in the room.

The residual sound remains in the room because of multiple reflections at rigid wall, ceiling and floor of the room. Since we cannot hypothesize any room-like structure in the earth, we attribute seismic coda waves to back-scattering from numerous heterogeneities in the earth. We may consider seismic coda as waves trapped in a random medium
