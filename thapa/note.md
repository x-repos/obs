# **Coda wave**
When an earthquake or underground explosion occurs in the earth, seismic waves are propagated away from the source. After P waves, S waves and various surface waves are gone, the area around the seismic source is still vibrating. The amplitude of vibration is uniform in space, except for the local site effect, which tends to amplify the motion at soft soil sites as compared to hard rock sites. This residual vibration is called seismic coda wave, and decays very slowly with time. The rate of decay is the same independent of the locations of seismic source and recording station, as long as they are located in a given region.

Coda waves cause site effect.

# **Autocorrelation**

Autocorrelation, sometimes known as serial correlation in the discrete time case, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. Informally, it is the similarity between observations of a random variable as a function of the time lag between them. The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a periodic signal obscured by noise, or identifying the missing fundamental frequency in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies

Seismic waves from distant earthquakes (is called teleseismic) arriving at seismic stations propagate near vertically and reflect from the free surface, propagate downward, and, subsequently, reflect back to the surface. Thus, a single station can be used to convert a coda wave train to a reflectivity record by means of computing the autocorrelation.
